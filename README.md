#Overview

BasketMaster is a project designed to analyze customer purchasing patterns and segment customers for enhanced marketing strategies. By utilizing market basket analysis and clustering techniques, this project provides insights that can help businesses optimize their sales approaches.


#Features

Market Basket Analysis: Implements the Apriori Algorithm to discover frequent product combinations and generate actionable association rules.
Customer Segmentation: Utilizes KMeans Clustering to categorize customers based on their purchasing habits, allowing for targeted marketing.
Interactive Visualizations: Generates 3D visualizations for both association rules and customer clusters, enhancing data interpretation.


#Technologies Used

Python: Primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.

Pandas & NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.

Scikit-learn: Implements clustering algorithms and preprocessing techniques.

Plotly: Creates interactive visualizations for data insights.

Faker: Generates synthetic transaction data for analysis.


#Data Generation

The project simulates customer transactions using the Faker library. A specified number of products, customers, and transactions are generated, allowing for realistic testing of algorithms and methodologies.


#Market Basket Analysis

The Apriori Algorithm identifies strong associations between products in customer transactions. It evaluates combinations based on specified thresholds for support and confidence, yielding valuable insights into customer buying behaviors.


#Customer Segmentation

KMeans Clustering groups customers based on their purchasing patterns. This segmentation enables businesses to identify high-value customer segments, enhancing the effectiveness of marketing strategies.


#Visualization

The project includes 3D visualizations generated using Plotly:

1)Association Rule Visualization: Displays the top association rules based on support, confidence, and lift.

2)Customer Cluster Visualization: Illustrates customer segments, facilitating the understanding of purchasing behaviors among different groups.
